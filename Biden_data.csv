fdei7j,Megathread: Michael Bloomberg Suspends 2020 Presidential Campaign and Endorses Former VP Joe Biden,"Mike Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday after a poor performance in the Super Tuesday primaries.

""Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump – because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult.""

Following his campaign departure, Bloomberg endorsed rival and former Vice President Joe Biden. ""I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,"" he said in the statement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fdei7j/megathread_michael_bloomberg_suspends_2020/,PoliticsModeratorBot,1,2020-03-04 08:22:46,29820,/r/politics/comments/fdei7j/megathread_michael_bloomberg_suspends_2020/,NaN
